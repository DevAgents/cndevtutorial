Thank you for installing the `springmsdemo` Helm chart!

1. hellospring Deployment:

To view the logs of the hellospring deployment pods:
$ kubectl logs -l app=hellospring

2. frontend Deployment:

To view the logs of the frontend deployment pods:
$ kubectl logs -l app=frontend

3. Accessing the Services:

- For `hello-service`:

You can access it internally within the cluster using:
$ kubectl run curlpod --image=radial/busyboxplus:curl -i --tty --rm
$ wget -qO- hello-service

If you have port-forwarding set up, or if it's exposed externally, you can access via:
http://[NODE_IP]:[NODE_PORT]

- For `frontend-service`:

Since the service is of type `NodePort`, you can access it externally using:
http://[NODE_IP]:[NODE_PORT]

Replace `[NODE_IP]` with the IP of your node and `[NODE_PORT]` with the NodePort assigned to the service. You can retrieve NodePort by:
$ kubectl get svc frontend-service -o=jsonpath='{.spec.ports[0].nodePort}'

Enjoy using the applications!
